Computer Science Student and Part-time Hiker!
</h2> 

Coming from Automotive sales, I have learned quite a bit, but never quite scratched the itch that learning new technology and making fun projects has given me. This has led me to pursue full-time studies as a Computer Science student, With a specialization in Software Engineering.


## I'm currently working on:

Full-time Studies including
  - Algorithms 2 and Advanced Algorithms
  - Operating Systems
  - Software Architecture
  - Networking
  - Capstone Project for MNRF


## I'm learning

C/C++ for Algorithms
Python
Web Development
  - Next.js
  - MongoDB
  - Firebase
  - Flutter
 
Exploring Security and Embedded

## Purpose of this project

This project was to explore and create a way to dynamically update information, without the need for full-time database maintenance. To accomplish this, I explored web scraping to extract information from the TrentU Website(I sought and obtained permission just in case). Utilizing agile for the project management to ensure appropriate planning and using technologies in Python such as BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium Web Drivers to accomplish this project

This was displayed to the user with a Discord bot with Discord.py. This allowed me to code everything in a new language and focus on learning and implementing Python, Which has since become one of my favorite languages (I still love C). 

Finally, this project is fully packaged, licensed, and deployed on pypi, so anyone with a discord token, Python3.10.8+, and pip installed can do: "pip install trentubuddy" to explore and use the project quickly and easily.

## To use this project

Python3.10.8+ is required as well as having PIP installed. It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment for this so, I used venv "python3 -m venv <venv name>" followed by "source <venv name>/bin/activate" on Linux. Then with this project folder installed OR the package installed with pip "Pip install trentubuddy" you will be able to explore both Discord bots and web scraping.

## Thank you.
